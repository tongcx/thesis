\subsection{Policy}

It's a nice idea to let sites help each. But we still need to figure out which diversion to do and how to evaluate the impact of these diversions. It is not a simple problem. It seems as simple as to just divert anyone from congested site to non-congested site. But the reality is more complicated than that. The system is stochastic and we cannot say for sure whether diversion is definitely better. We need to cope with risk. Also, congestion is temporal concept, some site is non-congested in the morning doesn't mean it will stay so in the afternoon, especially if its afternoon schedule is very tight.  Overall, this is a non-trivial problem and there are several things
we need to closely look after.

In this subsection, we will discuss what metrics we're looking for and how do we make sure our diversion will improve these metric with high chance.
