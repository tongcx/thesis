\section{Resource pooling}

In this section, we discuss why congestions happens throughout the day and how to deal it with resourcing pooling. Usually, each day starts with a nice schedule. However, as the day evolves, things don't always turn out perfectly. The reason is that there are lots of uncertainty that we cannot foresee and they can affect the daily operations. We have already discussed all these uncertainty in last section.
