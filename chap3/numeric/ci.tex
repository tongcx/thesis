\subsection{On confidence intervals}

Figure \ref{fig:ci} details the impact of our diversion policy for the 3 site
case with 60 minute lead time (this is essentially the same
curve for 60 minute lead time as in the first plot of Figure
\ref{fig:3sites_all}). The confidence intervals show that
the positive impact of our diversion policy is statistically
significant. Also, note that as we increase the fraction of
volunteers, the variance also increase. The reason is that,
when there are more volunteers, there are more diversions which
induce more variance. If we examine performance improvment
for other metric or for level of granularity, similar patterns
can be observed.
