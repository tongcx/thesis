\section{Computational Results}

We now present computational results for our diversion policy. Note that
we are omitting confidence intervals for the plots in this section. There
are two reasons for this. First, the plots in this section mostly
contain multiple lines, and so confidence intervals will substantially clutter
the plots. Second, for showing the statistical significance of
the improvement, it is more proper to plot the change of performance
with confidence intervals rather than to plot the performance itself.
We give two example plots at the end of this section.
