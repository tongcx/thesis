\section{Computational Results}

We now present computational results for our diversion policy. Note that
we are omitting confidence intervals for the plots in this section. There
are two reasons for this. First, the plots in this section mostly
contain multiple lines and confidence intervals will substantially clutter
the plots. Second, the number of replications we ran per experiment
leads to confidence intervals of size that do not confirm the statistical
significance of the improvement by our diversion policy. However, because
we used common random numbers across experiments, we are able to confirm
the statistical significance of the improvement by examining the confidence
intervals of the performance improvement (instead of the performance itself).
We include a plot on performance improvement at the end of this section.
