\section{Policy}

To carry out our idea of resource sharing, we need to figure out among all volunteers, who should we divert and where should we divert them to? It's not as simple as it sounds to just divert patients from congested site to non-congested site. Congestion is a temporal concept: a site is congested in morning doesn't mean it is so in afternoon. We need to define some objective measuring desirability of outcome and, then, we can identify diversions that can improve this objective. Another issue is that because of uncertainties, we don't have a clear-cut answer on whehter a diversion is beneficial or not. It may help or it may hurt. We need make a choice in face of stochastic outcome. Overall, we need to evaluate the impact of diversions with respect to some objective in stochastic setting.
