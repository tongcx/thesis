\section{System dynamics}

In this section, we introduce the dynamics of the system and uncertainty associated with them. There are several type of entities in the system: patients, sites, machines. We are going to discuss each type of entities and how to describe their status in the system. More importantly, we will describe the events corresponding to interaction between these entities. Most of these events are random that they happen randomly or happen at random time. It's important to understand the randomness associated with these events.
