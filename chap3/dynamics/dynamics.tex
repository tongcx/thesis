\section{System dynamics}

The system that we are concerned is a multi-site imaging facilities which have several type of entities: patients, sites, machines. We introduce the dynamics of the system and uncertainty associated with them. We describe each type of entities and their status tracked in the system. More importantly, we will describe the events corresponding to interaction between these entities. Most of these events are random that they happen randomly or happen at random time. So it's important to understand the randomness associated with these events.
