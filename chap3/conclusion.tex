\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we looked at the problem of congestion in an appointment
system with multiple facilities. We explored the approach to make
real-time diversions for resource sharing to balance demands.
We investigate the simple approach of making one diversion at
a time and use simulation and common random numbers to evaluate
proposed changes. This approach is intuitive and simple to
implement. Computational results show that this approach bring
meaningful improvement leading to fewer cases of patients with extreme waiting times
and decreased site overtime, while only a very small number of patients are diverted.
