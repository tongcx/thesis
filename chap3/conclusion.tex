\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we look at the problem of congestion in appointment
system with multiple facilities. We explored the approach to make
real-time diversion for resource sharing to balance demands.
We investigate the simple approach of making one diversion at
a time and use simulation and common random numbers to evaluate
proposed changes. This approach is intuitive and simple to
implement. Computational results show that this approach bring
meaningful improvement leading to less patients experiencing
long waiting time with very small number of patients being affected.
